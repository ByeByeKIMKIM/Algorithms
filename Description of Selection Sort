the selection sort algorithm is easy to understand
and implement, but it is quite inefficient. 

The time complexity is quite bad because of the double for loop.
The first loop through has (n-1) "things" (don't know the right vocab) to do
The next loop has (n-2), all the way to 1
If we add all these (n-1)+(n-2)+(n-3)+...+1
This equals
(n-1+1)*(n-1)/2 = n(n-1)/2
This expression has order 2 (x^2), so the Big O of this sorting algorithm is
O(n^2)

The space complexity is O(1) (constant) because regardless of the size of the
input array, the same amount of space is needed for storage variables like
"min", "index", etc
